# Zense-Project
This project consists of 5 files.
1. project.html
2. spring.html
3. calculations.html
4. spr.css
5. spring_mass_system.png

The files sholud be downloaded into the same folder.
Instructions to run the code:
1. open project.html
2. two options are available-simulation and calculation
3. if you click on calculation, you will be asked to enter the values of mass and spring constant and the amplitude will be calculated.
4. if you click on simulation, you can set the values of stiffness, damping constant, frequency and mass and the simulation changes accordingly.
